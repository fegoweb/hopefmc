          <span style="color: #008080; font-weight: normal">Karen Duarte</span> is the Office Manager for Hope Family Medical Center and is also a Certified Biller/Encoder. She came to Utah seventeen years ago from Guatemala which opened the door to many
          great opportunities for her. Karen credits learning English as one of these opportunities and reports that it wasn't as difficult as she thought it would be. In March 2014 Karen realized another great opportunity when she became a citizen of
          the United States. Karen owned and operated a highly successful commercial and residential cleaning service business for twelve years before selling her business to return to school.<br><br> “Going to school was another opportunity to improve
          my knowledge and better myself,” she states. She attended Salt Lake Community College and earned her certification in Billing & Coding plus she took additional classes so that she could learn more about business management in order to obtain
          a position as an Office Manager. Karen and Jody met in 2005 and have shared the dream of opening the Hope Family Medical Center to provide affordable health care services to underserved individuals and families in their community for many years.
          “Working at Hope Family Medical Center is a dream come true, where I can keep doing what I love, which is helping others by providing care and comfort to those in need”. Hope Family Medical Center is blessed to have Karen as our Office Manager
          and a lead member of our health care team.<br><br> Karen’s loves spending time with her family. Her hobbies include cooking and baking and reading good books. Her greatest aspiration is to go back to college to become a Clinical Psychologist.
          We look forward to Karen achieving her goal so that we can hire her to provide counseling services to our patients who have need of this service.
